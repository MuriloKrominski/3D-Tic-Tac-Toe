# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe

**3D Tic-Tac-Toe** is a modern twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, now with a third dimension! This Python project uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `Tkinter` to provide an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience.

Step into the ultimate nerdy showdown where strategy meets the z-axis! This isnâ€™t your ordinary 2D grid with just 8 ways to winâ€”itâ€™s a full 3D battlefield with **49 winning possibilities** across rows, columns, layers, and even diagonals that slice through space. Whether youâ€™re aligning in a plane or bending your mind to claim a cross-layer victory, this game will test your multi-dimensional tactical genius. Let the 3D mind games begin! ðŸš€ðŸŽ²

## Gameplay Instructions
1. The game opens with a 3D board divided into three layers, each layer being a 3x3 grid.
2. Players alternate turns to place their marks (`X` or `O`) by clicking on empty cells.
3. A player wins if they align three of their marks in:
   - A row, column, or diagonal in the same layer.
   - The same position across all three layers.
   - A diagonal crossing multiple layers (e.g., top-left on layer 1 to bottom-right on layer 3).
4. The game ends with a winner or a tie if all cells are filled.
5. Use the **Restart Game** button to play another round.
